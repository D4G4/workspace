#What is `let`

If you declare a variable with a global scope and then you declare the
same variable inside a 'loop' or an 'if' statement, then that newly created variable's scope
will me limited to the 'loop' or 'if' statement.

`let` allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement
or expression on which it is used.
Unlike `var` keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an
entire function regardless of block scope.
