1. We generate a project with `react-native cli`.
2. This produces a new react made of project capable of running both
   Android and IOS apps
3. We start a simulator using
      `react-native run ios`
      `react-native run android`

4. We created quite a few components, we found out that there were
  two different types of components inside React Native.
    * Class Based Components :
          -> Have access to component level state and lifecycle methods

    * Functional Components :
          -> which are largely presentational components that
             produce some amount of JSX and show some data to the user

5. Speaking of States :
  We used State inside AlbumList component.
  State is available to Class based component.
  State is used to record and react to user actions.

  Here, we fetched a list of albums and we assigned or updated the list using
  `this.setState()` -> triggers `render()`

6. Make HTTP request using `axious`

7. Then we created our AlbumDetail component.
  by mapping over our list of albums.

  We pass a single album item to AlbumDetail component by
  specifying "props"
  Props is a data that a parent component passes to it's child component(s)
